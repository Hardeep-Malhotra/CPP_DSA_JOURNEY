# 📘 Flowcharts and Pseudocode

This repository contains **learning material, examples, and practice problems** for **Flowcharts and Pseudocode** — the two most important fundamentals before learning **Programming** and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.

## 🔰 What is Pseudocode?

**Pseudocode** is a plain-English representation of a program or algorithm.  
It is **not a programming language** — it is simply a way to **think and plan logic** before writing actual code.

### ✔ Key Features
- No syntax rules
- Easy to write
- Easy to understand
- Helps convert logic into real code later

### 🧾 Example: Add Two Numbers

START
INPUT A, B
SUM = A + B
PRINT SUM
END



---

## 🔷 What is a Flowchart?

A **flowchart** is a **visual diagram** that represents the steps of an algorithm using **symbols and arrows**.

### ✔ It helps in:
- Understanding program flow
- Debugging logic
- Explaining algorithms to others

## 🧩 Flowchart Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| 🔶 Oval | Start / End |
| ⬛ Parallelogram | Input / Output |
| ⬜ Rectangle | Process / Calculation |
| 🔻 Diamond | Decision (if / else) |
| ➡ Arrows | Flow direction |

## 🆚 Pseudocode vs Flowchart

| Pseudocode | Flowchart |
|----------|----------|
| Written text | Visual diagram |
| Very fast to write | Comparatively slow |
| Easy to edit | Hard to modify |
| Widely used in exams | Used in design phase |
| Less visual | Highly visual |

## 📝 Examples

### ✔ Example 1: Check Even or Odd

#### Pseudocode

START
INPUT N
IF N % 2 == 0 THEN
PRINT "Even"
ELSE
PRINT "Odd"
END IF
END



#### Flowchart Steps
1. Start  
2. Input number `N`  
3. Check condition `N % 2 == 0`  
4. Yes → Output **Even**  
5. No → Output **Odd**  
6. End

### ✔ Example 2: Find Factorial of a Number

#### Pseudocode

START
INPUT N
FACT = 1
FOR I = 1 TO N
FACT = FACT * I
END FOR
PRINT FACT
END

## 🏁 Why Learn Flowcharts & Pseudocode First?

Because they help you:

- ✔ Think like a programmer  
- ✔ Build logic before syntax  
- ✔ Reduce coding errors  
- ✔ Understand DSA easily  
- ✔ Write cleaner programs  

💡 **Professionals always design the algorithm first, code later.**

## 🧠 Practice Questions

Try to create **both flowchart & pseudocode** for:

- Sum of first N natural numbers  
- Largest of three numbers  
- Reverse a number  
- Check prime number  
- Print Fibonacci series  
- Find sum of elements of array  
- Check palindrome number
